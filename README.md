# Baby Tools

This is a list of products and strategies that could help with having a new born.


## Strategies
### Checklists
You will be braindead a lot. When you are not braindead, make checklists that you can use when you are braindead. Stuff like "all of the daily chores at home" so when you are fried and awake you can look at it and then go "right, I should take out the trash" instead of just standing in your kitchen drooling.


## Tools
The idea is to keep the number of things to buy as minimal as possible
